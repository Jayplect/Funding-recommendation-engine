## Overview of the Analysis
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup (a fictional company) wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I utilized the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data Description
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:
`EIN and NAME`—Identification columns,
`APPLICATION_TYPE`—Alphabet Soup application type,
`AFFILIATION`—Affiliated sector of industry,
`CLASSIFICATION`—Government organization classification,
`USE_CASE`—Use case for funding,
`ORGANIZATION`—Organization type,
`STATUS`—Active status,
`INCOME_AMT`—Income classification,
`SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`—Special considerations for application,
`ASK_AMT`—Funding amount requested,
`IS_SUCCESSFUL`—Was the money used effectively.

## Results

- Data Preprocessing

Under this step, I prepared the dataset that will be used for training and testing the classifier. Because of the question I wanted to answer, I selected `IS_SUCCESSFUL` as the target of my model while the remaining dataset formed the features. After inspecting if the dataset contained features relevant to predicting the success of applicants, I decided to remove the identification features. Preprocessing steps also included checking for and handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. In addition, I observed that the exact value of some of the features was not as important as the general range or category they fall into. Accordingly, in order to smoothen out noise in the dataset I binned some of the features (`APPLICATION_TYPE` and `CLASSIFICATION`) by grouping similar values in feature together. 
  - example of binning
        
        # look at field value counts for binning
        unique_fields = df.field.value_counts()
        
        # Choose a cutoff value and create a list of classifications to be replaced
        cutoff_value = value
        field_to_replace = list(unique_fields[unique_fields < cutoff_value].index)

        # Replace in dataframe
        for field in field_to_replace:
            df['FIELD'] = df['FIELD'].replace(field,"Other")

        # Check to make sure binning was successful
        df['FIELD'].value_counts()

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
