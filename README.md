## Overview of the Analysis
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I utilized the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data Description
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:
`EIN and NAME`—Identification columns,
`APPLICATION_TYPE`—Alphabet Soup application type,
`AFFILIATION`—Affiliated sector of industry,
`CLASSIFICATION`—Government organization classification,
`USE_CASE`—Use case for funding,
`ORGANIZATION`—Organization type,
`STATUS`—Active status,
`INCOME_AMT`—Income classification,
`SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`—Special considerations for application,
`ASK_AMT`—Funding amount requested,
`IS_SUCCESSFUL`—Was the money used effectively.

## Results

- Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

What variable(s) are the features for your model?

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?


Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
